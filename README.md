# README

Repo with my own config to setup on multiple machines.


## Setup
Asuming you have vim installed.

This will create a `.vimrc` if it does not exist, but if it exist it will override the contents so be careful.
```bash
chmod +x main.sh
./main.sh
```

## Guide
For autocompletion, when you see the popupbox, `Tab` and `Shift+Tab` moves arround.
